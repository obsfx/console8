# console8 [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/console8.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/console8)

`console8` is *yet another chip8 emulator* but works on your **command line**. `console8` simply uses your command line to render the graphics and does not require any GUI. 



# installation

```
npm install -g console8
```

`console8` uses `iohook` package to handle the keyboard events so you may have to install with `sudo` and -`-unsafe-perm=true` for post installation and execute with `sudo` to get necessary permissions from your system.

# how to use

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/obsfx/console8/master/media/1.gif)

You can simply use by passing `--rom` argument with the path of the rom file.

```
console8 --rom=./roms/wipeoff.rom
```

You can customize the display color and character by using this additional arguments;

```
--color=<rendering color of ON bits> (optional, default: white)
available colors: white, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan

--speed=<speed of cycle execution, 1000 / speed> (optional, default: 450)

--rendering_char=<ascii char that represents ON bits> (optional, default: â–ˆ)
```

You can also see all available arguments by using --help argument;

```
console8 --help
```

# a warning

`console8` is an *experimental learning project* so some roms can be **buggy**.



# compatibility

I have tested on **Ubuntu 19.10** / **Lubuntu 19.10** / **Windows 10 x64**. I am not sure about macOS compatibility.



# for rom files

Rom files are not included with npm installation but you can find some of them in this github repository;
